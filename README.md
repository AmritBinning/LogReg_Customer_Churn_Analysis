# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of customer churn for a phone company, focusing on identifying the demographics and factors that contribute to customer churn. The analysis also includes the creation of a logistic regression model to predict customer churn and exporting the results into CSV files.

## Introduction

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of customer churn within a phone company. The main objectives were to understand the characteristics of customers who have left the company (churners) and those who have stayed, as well as to identify the key factors influencing customer churn.

## Demographic Analysis

I started by analysing the demographics of churners. This involved examining factors such as gender, age, and other relevant demographic information. By comparing these characteristics between churners and non-churners, I gained insights into the demographic profile of customers more likely to churn.

## Factors Influencing Customer Stay

Identifying the factors that encourage customers to stay is crucial for customer retention. Through exploratory data analysis, I pinpointed the key factors that make a person more likely to remain a customer. This information is valuable for targeted retention strategies.

## Factors Affecting Customer Churn

Understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn is equally important. I delved into the various factors that have the most influence on someone's decision to churn. This analysis provides actionable insights for the company to address pain points and improve customer satisfaction.

## Logistic Regression Model

To predict future instances of customer churn, I developed a logistic regression model. This model utilises the identified factors to calculate the likelihood of a customer churning. As a result, I was able to create a list of the top 500 customers at high risk of churn based on the model's predictions.

## CSV Export

The results of the logistic regression analysis were exported into CSV files for further use. I generated two separate CSV files: one containing the list of the top 500 customers predicted to churn, and another containing the remaining customers along with their associated probabilities of churning.
